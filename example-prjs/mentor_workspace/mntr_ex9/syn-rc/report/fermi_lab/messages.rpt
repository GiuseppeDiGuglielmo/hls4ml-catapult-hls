  2 Warning ENV_PA-36  In future releases setting max_leakage_power       
                       attribute will not enable leakage power            
                       optimization on its own.                           
                       Setting leakage_power_effort to 'none' will        
                       enable the backward compatible mode.               
  2   Info  LBR-412    Created nominal operating condition.               
                       The nominal operating condition represents either  
                       the nominal PVT values if specified in the         
                       library source, or the default PVT values (1.0,    
                       1.0, 1.0).                                         
  6   Info  LBR-415    Found unusable library cells.                      
                       For more information, refer to 'Cells Identified   
                       as Unusable' in the RC User Guide. The number of   
                       unusable cells that is listed depends on the       
                       setting of the 'information_level' root            
                       attribute. If set to a value less than 6, the      
                       list is limited to 10 unusable cells. If set to a  
                       value equal to or higher than 6, all unusable      
                       cells are listed.                                  
 40 Warning LBR-81     Non-monotonic wireload model found.                
                       Non-monotonic wireload models can cause problems   
                       during synthesis and/or mapping.  Raising some of  
                       the points in the curve to give it a monotonic     
                       shape.                                             
 28 Warning LBR-9      Library cell has no output pins defined.           
                       Add the missing output pin(s), then reload the     
                       library. Otherwise, the library cell will be       
                       marked as unusable and as timing model.            
  3 Warning PHYS-12    The variant range of wire parameters is too large. 
                       Make sure to check the consistency of the          
                       parameters.                                        
 27   Info  PHYS-129   Via with no resistance will have a value of '0.0'  
                       assigned.                                          
  3  Error  PHYS-6187  Lef files are read when design exists.             
                       Set the 'lef_library' attribute before doing       
                       'elab'.                                            
  3 Warning RPT_CG-12  Potential error generating clock gating report.    
                       The 'report clock_gating' command depends on the   
                       'lp_insert_clock_gating' attribute.  Set it to     
                       'true' before calling this command.                
  3 Warning RPT_DP-100 The filename, column and line number information   
                       will not be available in the report.               
                       You must set the 'hdl_track_filename_row_col'      
                       attribute to 'true' (before elaborate) to enable   
                       filename, column, and line number tracking in the  
                       datapath report.                                   
  2 Warning TIM-11     Possible timing problems have been detected in     
                       this design.                                       
                       Use 'report timing -lint' for more information.    
  3  Error  TUI-24     The data value for this attribute is invalid.      
                       To see the usage/description for this attribute,   
                       type 'set_attribute -h <attr_name> *'.             
  1  Error  TUI-61     A required object parameter could not be found.    
                       Check to make sure that the object exists and is   
                       of the correct type.  The 'what_is' command can    
                       be used to determine the type of an object.
