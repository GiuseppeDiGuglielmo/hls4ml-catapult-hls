  1   Info  ENC_MSV-301 Design has no library or power domains.            
                        No power domains will be created for Encounter.    
  1 Warning ENV_PA-36   In future releases setting max_leakage_power       
                        attribute will not enable leakage power            
                        optimization on its own.                           
                        Setting leakage_power_effort to 'none' will        
                        enable the backward compatible mode.

  2   Info  GLO-34      Deleting instances not driving any primary         
                        outputs.                                           
                        Optimizations such as constant propagation or      
                        redundancy removal could change the connections    
                        so an instance does not drive any primary outputs  
                        anymore. To see the list of deleted instances,     
                            set the 'information_level' attribute to 2 or  
                        above.                                             
  3   Info  LBR-155     Mismatch in unateness between 'timing_sense'       
                        attribute and the function.                        
                        The 'timing_sense' attribute will be respected.

  1   Info  LBR-40      An unsupported construct was detected in this      
                        library.                                           
                        Check to see if this construct is really needed    
                        for synthesis.  Many liberty constructs are not    
                        actually required.                                 
  1   Info  LBR-412     Created nominal operating condition.               
                        The nominal operating condition represents either  
                        the nominal PVT values if specified in the         
                        library source, or the default PVT values (1.0,    
                        1.0, 1.0).                                         
  3   Info  LBR-415     Found unusable library cells.                      
                        For more information, refer to 'Cells Identified   
                        as Unusable' in the RC User Guide. The number of   
                        unusable cells that is listed depends on the       
                        setting of the 'information_level' root            
                        attribute. If set to a value less than 6, the      
                        list is limited to 10 unusable cells. If set to a  
                        value equal to or higher than 6, all unusable      
                        cells are listed.

 20 Warning LBR-81      Non-monotonic wireload model found.                
                        Non-monotonic wireload models can cause problems   
                        during synthesis and/or mapping.  Raising some of  
                        the points in the curve to give it a monotonic     
                        shape.                                             
 14 Warning LBR-9       Library cell has no output pins defined.           
                        Add the missing output pin(s), then reload the     
                        library. Otherwise, the library cell will be       
                        marked as unusable and as timing model.

                        The 'report clock_gating' command depends on the   
                        'lp_insert_clock_gating' attribute.  Set it to

                        An external clock does not directly drive any      
                        points within the design, but is only used as a    
                        reference for external delays.
